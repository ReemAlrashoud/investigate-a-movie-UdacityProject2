## Introduction
basiclly , in this report i talked about dataset of movies and how cleaning the data from dublicated values and missing values.
after that i built some research question that is the basic of the methods, so all of the information and creative ideas that you will find it in this report it show the detaild answer of the question.

**The RESEARCH QUESTIONS ARE:**

**FIRST/** Is there a relation between popularity and Vote ? 

**SECOND/** which movie id had the highest budget ? 

**THIRD/** What are the top 5 directors they generate the highest revenue ? 

**FOURTH/** Can we Visualize Count of released year for movies ?

## Conclusions
in conclusion , i aim some cleared results such as: first of all , when the movie becomes a popular it will get more voting , also the max value of voting is around 10000.
As a second idea , the budget is oscillating with the id because movies with id around 2000-6500 is lower budget than movies with id around 7000-10000.
Third idea , i summrized the top 5 directors that they generate the highest revenue that means they have a huge impact on movies world.
Fourth idea , i count the movie valuse of the release year that can help us to visulize the number of movies in each year and as we see it increase year by year without any decreasing.

## limitation

The analysis is limited only on the place of the data was gathring.Also when i try to compute a statistics for genders it has a huge data i can not gather them in a figure or find a way to represent them.
Moreover, there is a lot of missing values that has an impact on the analysis especially in the revenue and budget values.
